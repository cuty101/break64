# break64
This is a base64 encoder/decoder showing the full conversion process

This script just shows you how base64 works behind the scenes. Since there are explanations online, I think it would be nice to automate this and show how it actually works with any type of string provided to the script.

Run this with python3

Execute this script on the command line
$ python break64.py
$ python3 break64.py

If your CMD does not have python installed, you can run it on any linux with python3 installed

This python3 program is created by Verno.
