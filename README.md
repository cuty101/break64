# break64
This is a base64 encoder/decoder showing the full conversion process

This script just shows you how base64 works behind the scenes.  
Since there are explanations online, I think it would be nice to automate this and show how it actually works with any type of string provided to the script.

Run this with python3, Execute this script on the command line

$ python3 break64.py

This python3 program is created by Verno.
